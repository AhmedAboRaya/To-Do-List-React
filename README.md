# To-Do List Project

## Overview

This To-Do List project is a simple and intuitive web application designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. Users can add new tasks, delete existing ones, and mark tasks as completed. The application includes validation to ensure a smooth user experience by preventing duplicate entries and empty task additions.

## Features

- **Add Items**: Users can add new tasks to their to-do list. Each task must have a unique name, ensuring no duplicate tasks are added.
- **Delete Items**: Users can remove tasks from their list with a single click, allowing them to keep their task list up-to-date.
- **Mark Items**: Users can mark tasks as completed by clicking on the checkbox next to each task. This helps users keep track of their progress.
- **Validation**: The application includes validation to prevent users from adding tasks with the same name or adding tasks when the input field is empty. This ensures that the to-do list remains organized and clutter-free.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: The application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React's component-based architecture allows for efficient and reusable code.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling, Tailwind CSS is used. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to build custom designs without writing CSS.

2. **Deleting a Task**: Click the "Delete" button next to the task you want to remove. The task will be deleted from the list.
3. **Marking a Task**: Click the checkbox next to the task you want to mark as completed. The task will be visually marked, indicating it has been completed.
